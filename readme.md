# AXIS - AI for eXposing Insurance Scams

## Project Overview

The **AXIS** project aims to implement the latest advancements in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to create a novel **Intelligent Insurance Fraud Detection System (IIFDS)**. By identifying high-risk behaviors and patterns, AXIS enables the early detection of potentially fraudulent activity, transforming **Industry**'s approach to insurance fraud.

This system will help improve the efficiency of the insurance claims process and ensure a proactive approach to fraud detection. Key focus areas include:

- **Risk Scoring Models-RSM**: Building predictive models based on both internal and external data sources to flag high-risk individuals and/or claims early, enabling the potential refusal of sales or charging higher premiums.
  
- **Network Analytics-NTA**: Developing models that connect individual and device details to identify duplicate accounts, often used to mask fraudulent activity.
  
- **Call Transcript Analytics-CTA**: Leveraging NLP and Generative AI (Gen-AI) models to analyze customer phone call transcripts, identifying key fraud indicators and flagging them for review.

- **Fraud Detection Ecosystem-FDE**: Creating an ecosystem that enhances the work of operational teams by automating fraud detection processes, improving both speed and accuracy.

The AXIS system applies **state-of-the-art AI techniques** to mitigate risk and fraud, improving operational efficiency and setting a new standard for the insurance industry.
